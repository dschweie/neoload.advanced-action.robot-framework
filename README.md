# Why do I need this project?

For load and performance testing, it can be useful to integrate existing test cases 
from the test automation.

With the advanced action for Robot Framework, test cases can be used from within 
Tricentis NeoLoad. This not only reduces development times, but also makes it 
possible to **measure the end user experience**.

While NeoLoad focuses on response times, Robot Framework tests an application more 
from a user interface perspective. This means that the end user experience includes 
the response time and the time needed to prepare the data.
